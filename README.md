A. Customer Journey
</summary> 
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from theÂ subscriptionsÂ table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

````sql
select s.*,p.plan_name,p.price
from dbo.subscriptions s 
join dbo.plans p 
on s.plan_id = p.plan_id 
where customer_id in (1,4,6,23,49,58,79,80)
order by customer_id
````
**Steps**
1. Choose 8 random customers and analyze behavior of them
2. Which plan did they use ? Did they upgrade plan after use free trial ?
